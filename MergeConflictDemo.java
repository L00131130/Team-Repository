#MergeConflictDemo
#
#This document was pulled down from the remote repository
#
#This line was edited on the remote repository after the user pulled the document down to local
#
#
#and this is the edit that was made by the user on the local repository for pulled it down
#
#When the user attempts to push the commits (changes to line 8) a merge conflict will occur because line 5 will not match with the remote repository version
